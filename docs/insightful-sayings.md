> When you understand something poorly - as the explorers understood geography, and as we understand neural nets today - **it’s more important to explore boldly than it is to be rigorously correct in every step of your thinking**.  
当你对某事了解甚少时——就像探险家之前对地理了解的那样，以及我们今天了解神经网络一样——**大胆探索比在你思维的每一步都保持绝对正确更为重要**。
